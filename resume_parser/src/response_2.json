Here is the extracted information in a JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Doe\",\n  \"email\": \"john.doe@example.com\",\n  \"phoneNumber\": \"+1 123 456 7890\",\n  \"address\": \"Cityville, State\",\n  \"skills\": [\n    \"Excellent Communication\",\n    \"Teamwork and Collaboration\",\n    \"Problem Solving\",\n    \"Customer Service\",\n    \"Sales and Marketing\"\n  ]\n}\n```\nHere's how I extracted the information:\n\n* `firstName`: Since the text doesn't mention a first name, I left this field empty.\n* `lastName`: The text mentions \"John Doe\", so I filled in the last name field with \"Doe\".\n* `email`: The text mentions an email address, so I filled in the email field with \"john.doe@example.com\".\n* `phoneNumber`: The text mentions a phone number, so I filled in the phone number field with \"+1 123 456 7890\".\n* `address`: The text mentions a location, so I filled in the address field with \"Cityville, State\".\n* `skills`: The text lists several skills, so I created an array of skill names and filled it in with the skills mentioned in the text.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance."
